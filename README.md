Much credit to @Pwn20wnd. We basically fixed his stuff and added more features. We do not want to compete. Not our intention.


Please note, while it is being said we "ripped off" unc0ver. This is false. And using their APT bootstrap is kinda a crazy thing to say we ripped off of it. Yeah, we used it because it was there. It's just a collection of debs. Cydia is in there as well. All of the tools used in this jailbreak (as well ad unc0vers) were public. And free to use.
